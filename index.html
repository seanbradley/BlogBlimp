            <h4>What is this?</h4>
            <p><strong>BlogBlimp is a company&mdash;a consultancy and affiliated team of web developers and programmers&mdash;working in next-generation technologies in support of professional creative people who want to expand their audience globally.</strong></p>
            <br />
            <h4>How does it work?</h4>
            <p><a href="../contact.html"><strong>Go to our contact page to get started. </strong></a>  You can meet with us in person if you're in Los Angeles&mdash;or from anywhere via Skype. We talk <i>with</i> you (not at you) about technology.  You leave with <i>actionable</i> knowledge that will transform your business or career.</p>
            <br />
            <p><i>Our</i> goal is ensure every conversation we have together results in information genuinely useful in achieving <i>your</i> goals&mdash;information that enables you to take manageable, step-by-step progress toward realizing your vision online...particularly if your objective is a worldwide fan base.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>So, you just build websites, right?</h4>
            <p>Yes.  We make websites.  We architect very <i>strong</i>, <i>fast</i>, <i>dynamic</i>, and <i>globally distributed</i> web applications capable of performing on any device and holding up to major bursts of traffic.  We produce and integrate streaming, rights-protected video that plays all over the world and on any nearly any device without stuttering.  We make websites for people who have an important message, and who want and/or expect <i>a lot</i> of people around the world to hear or see that message.  We build, customize, optimize, host, and train people to use <i>amazing</i>, state-of-the-art and experimental technologies that help broadcast high-bandwidth content around the entire world via <strong>The Cloud</strong>.  If BlogBlimp builds you a website, it's unlikely you'll ever need a new one, because we'll maintain it and upgrade it for free...<i>forever</i>.  So, in that sense: <strong>no</strong>: we don't "just" build websites. :)  We build tools that help important and creative people change the world.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>How much does it cost?</h4>
            <p>Information from our initial consultation is always free.  We make no sales pitch during our consultation with you.  Serving as a clearinghouse of tech-related information and resources for the arts community is simply our way of giving back and paying it forward.</p>
            <br>
            <h4>How do you make money?</h4>
            <p>BlogBlimp is funded by our activities as artists.  We make money <i>if</i> and <i>only if</i> you ask us to build something <strong>special</strong> for you.  And even then, we only make money if you use what we build to make money for yourself.  We never <i>sell</i> you anything.  (Trust us: eventually, you're probably going to want more than knowledge.  Rest assured, however, if you ask us for something and we can't simply give it to you, we'll happily tell you where you can find it.  If you do ask us to build something special, and there's a way you can acquire it cheaper than the manner in which we can provide it, we'll tell you about your alternatives in an unbiased way.)</p>

            <h2>What is "The Cloud"?</h2>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>The Cloud is another way of referring to computer hardware, software, content delivery networks (CDNs), and other computing resources continuing to evolve toward metered (pay-as-you-go) services that are shared and distributed all over the planet.  Our hand-crafted blogs and websites are bred, raised, and live in The Cloud.  Think of The Cloud as the web...on steroids.  Using a traditional website is like driving a beat-up jalopy.  The Cloud is a Ferrari.  (Or better yet: a Bugatti Veyron!)</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Aren't websites like Facebook and YouTube in "The Cloud"?</h4>
            <p>Yes. But <i>your</i> website should be the primary means by which your various online initiatives work together to maximize your reach globally.  In fact, right now, it's the only way you can have a truly <i>global</i> reach.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Can you build something in The Cloud for me for free?</h4>
            <p>We're inclined to build something for you if we believe in what you're doing.  We build a lot of different things for free.  Some free projects are worthwhile for you <i>and</i> for us; some are not.  We're always interested in working with awesome live talent.  But: we're about as turned on to build something for you for free as you are inclined to perform for free.  If you meet or speak with us, you will find the free information we have to share with you is <i>very</i> valuable in and of itself.  Life-changing, in fact.  (No joke.)  <a href="../contact.html"><strong>Go to our contact page to get started</strong></a>, and then, after meeting, if your project is mutually interesting, we'll talk about building either something for you for free, or about making something special.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Do you make video games? ...Facebook apps? ...<small>i</small>Phone apps?</h4>
            <p>No.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Do you install and skin WordPress, Django, Drupal, the blogging platform of my choice, etc?</h4>
            <p>Yes, we can.  But, in most cases, we avoid platforms and frameworks which tip the scales toward making an unnecessarily bloated code base for your web app.  Whenever possible, we try to keep the code for your site super simple.  Keeping things simple enables a website to be fast and light and strong.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Can you skin and customize our Facebook, Amazon, Paypal, or Shopify store?</h4>
            <h4>Can you build for me an online shopping cart and integrate it with drop shipping?</h4>
            <p>(See the previous answer.)</p>
            <br />
            <h4>Do you provide Service Level Agreements (SLA<small>s</small>) or minimum uptme agreements?</h4>
            <p>Yes, we can&mdash;if it suits the scope project.  Essentially, regardless of the project's size or budget, we seek to develop code that's bulletproof and then we deploy it on the most robust platforms commercially available.</p>
            <br />
            <hr>
            <br />
            <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>It's 2012, and&mdash;would you believe it&mdash;but still more than 1 in 4 people on the planet with internet access cannot watch your video!  The planet is a big, big place, and not all websites are equally equipped to travel the information superhighway.  The web is growing up <i>fast</i>, however, and it's getting bigger (and more culturally diverse) all the time.  At the same time, content is more filtered and personalized than ever before.  Do people really know about you and the cool things you're making?  If they do happen to know about you, is the presence of your art online helping you make a living?  If you're in the business of cultural entertainment, of presenting the finest that humanity has to offer, we want to make sure you stay in business for generations to come.</p>
            <br />
            <p>And: did you know that while <strong>Google</strong> is the go-to website for Americans seeking information about you on the web, in Asia, it's <strong>Baidu</strong> that is the search engine of choice?  Facebook is the most popular online social network in the United States, but, in Brasil and India, it's presently <strong>Orkut</strong>.  In the past, did you use Friendster, then MySpace, and now use <strong>Facebook</strong>?  In the past, did you use CD Baby, iTunes, and now use Amazon to purchase recorded music?  Well, you'll surely use the next network or platform when it becomes available.  But the domain you own&mdash;your personal or branded website&mdash;like your actual name and phone number, you'll want to make sure that remains the preferred way for fans to connect with you and what you do from year to year.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Moreover, did you also know: smartphones are, by far, the means by which most people learn about and watch you online?  In spite of their increasing popularity, <strong>Apple</strong> devices, make up less than 10% of global market share, and many internet-enabled phones do not display content requiring Flash or other video encodings popular in the U.S.  Sometimes technology and politics are intertwined.  For instance, YouTube and Facebook are totally inaccessible in many parts of China.  Yet Asia is one of the biggest and hottest markets for Western artists! Smart artists and arts organizations know that their content doesn't need to be constrained to any one part of the globe, nor to any one type of device.  A well-built website can liberate you from being locked into any one platform, and help you ride above restrictive corporate and government policies.  If you registered your domain name at <strong>GoDaddy</strong>, use <strong>Blogger</strong>, <strong>Tumblr</strong>, or <strong>Virb</strong> to host your website...  If you rely on Facebook, YouTube, and <strong>Vimeo</strong> to host your videos...  Or: if you just hope and pray Google, <strong>Yahoo</strong>, and <strong>Bing</strong> will index your site and enable everyone on the planet to find you...  Well, then you <i>might</i> do okay, but your fan base won't be a truly global one. Moreover, if you're fishing in an increasingly crowded domestic pond where&mdash;when it comes to support and funding&mdash;<i>everyone</i> is angling for the same piece of the pie, you're limiting your potential returns.  If that discribes your circumstance, maybe it's time to weigh anchor and float up to the wild blue skies of the larger world-wide web.  BlogBlimp&mdash;standing-by and ready to help&mdash;will help prevent technology from clipping your wings.</p>
            <br >
            <h4>We're hearing a lot about Amazon lately. Why?</h4>
            <p><strong>Amazon EC2</strong>&mdash;or <i>Elastic Cloud Compute</i> is part of The Cloud&mdash;a service providing access to the hardware, the physical computers that comprise The Cloud. Amazon went online with this service way back in 2006, and have since expanded their cloud-based services to include other very useful offerings.  The Cloud is not so new anymore.  <strong>Software as a Service</strong> (also known as Saas)&mdash;such as online wordprocessing, spreadsheets, and other web-based utilities like <strong>Google Apps</strong>&mdash;has been around for a while, also since the mid-2000s.  <strong>Platform as a Service</strong> (PaaS), <strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (IaaS), and other funky acronyms have emerged to explain this trend.  In short, the need to access the hardware and software that runs in The Cloud&mdash;like Amazon EC2&mdash;is growing at an exponential rate. The need to store, transport, edit, and broadcast large media files&mdash;like audio and video files&mdash;is likewise helping to increase the adoption of cloud-based technologies.  There are many companies now offering services in The Cloud.  There are good and smart reasons for using The Cloud, so you might also want to consider if making a move to The Cloud is right for you.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Because The Cloud is everywhere, mobile devices (just like desktop and laptop computers) also rely heavily on The Cloud.  As the number of web-enabled apps for these devices proliferate, it fuels the growth of The Cloud even further.  The Cloud is comprised of web servers, databases, and load balancers.  These computers can be rapidly configured in The Cloud as heavy-duty, big-data crunching clusters...or even one teeny-tiny, stand-alone microcomputer can be shared or reserved for use.  You can rent these computers by the hour, a month, a year&mdash;whatever you want&mdash;and then access them through your mobile device, or with your laptop or desktop browser...anywhere you have internet access.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Using The Cloud is especially advantageous for creative people on the go&mdash;especially touring and travelling artists.  The CLoud is an especially important enabler of globally distributed creative teams.  It's also usually much, <i>much</i> cheaper to run your personal or business website in The Cloud&mdash;more so than it is to buy and maintain a web server in your own home, studio, or workplace.  Computers break and need to be updated more often than cars or real estate.  Hardware depreciates rapidly, and, while leveraging your existing hardware is often the cheapest alternative, it's seldom a great long-term investment. So: why buy when you can rent?  And, the best part is: as the cost of storage online approaches zero, using The Cloud is <i>free</i> or nearly free, depending on the size of your fan-base, or your website's traffic.</p>
            <br />
            <h4>What do you talk about in your initial consultation?</h4>
            <p>It depends entirely on your needs.  Assessing your needs and helping you articulate them is one of the very first things we do, if they have not already been stated in clear terms.  Here's a sampling of what can help you with...<br />-->
