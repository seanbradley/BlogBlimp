            <p>What we build is made with love in Los Angeles, California. We're a charming, results oriented, and agile development team&mdash;and, most importantly, we're gifted and easy-going communicators who take the headache out of the web's new-fangled best practices.  Use BlogBlimp to become a rockstar navigator of the web's trickiest technologies.  You're the captain of your ship... Let's hoist anchor and head for the skies together.</p><br />
            <p>We've been building websites for just over 20 years.  Our knowledge base and industry contacts exploded when we began figuring out how to stream internet videos inside of mainland China. That experience gives us the toolkit we need to do amazing things here at home and abroad&mdash;whether you just want to publish your newest recipe online, or edge out the competition in a fierce global marketplace.</p><br />
            <p>If you're curious, here's some of the awesome goodness we might use behind the scenes to build the website of your dreams...</p><br />
               
              <ul>
                  <li>Amazon Web Services</li>
                  <li>Google Cloud Platform</li>
                  <li>HTML5 / CSS3, Javascript / JQuery, and Python</li>
                  <li>And something a little bit lighter than the prevailing atmosphere...</li>
              </ul><br />

                  <p>We think simple is better.  Einstein once said: "â€ŽMake things as simple as possible but no simpler." That's our credo.</p><br />
                  <p>Blimps and websites have something in common: the more stuff you put in them, the heavier they are, and the slower they go.  So we keep our internal practices agile.  And, more importantly, we don't fill the framework and engine of your website with a lot of unnecessary baggage.  We keep it light, and fast.  Our websites are built to perform at blazing speed, and under extreme conditions, with important failsafes and security measures for the myriad of unexpected conditions which can bring even the smartest and most creative business to a grinding halt.  If your creativity is driven by a highly visible cause-based or diplomatic agenda, or whether your art is funded and your fans supplied via internatioinal e-commerce, we build websites that stand up to the harshest rigors of today's online environment.</p><br />
                  <p>We are language agnostic.  That means, both in regard to programming languages used by machines, <i>and</i> words used by humans, we'll use the best tool for the task at hand.  We won't try to force a particular platform, or solution into your workflow&mdash;but we do believe all technologies are <i>not</i> created equal.  Fads exist in all areas of human endeavor, however, so, internally, within our own business, we guard against herd mentality and groupthink.  Moreover, we abhor planned obsolecense, and we constantly seek out next generation and futureproof solutions for the sake of your site's performance and your success. We won't always resort to rocket science, but we will do the heavy-lifting so you feel lighter than air.  You'll find bringing your visions to life with BlogBlimp is a breeze, and, more importantly, <i>fun</i>.</p><br />
