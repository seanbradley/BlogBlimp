<h1>A CURSORY FORMAL OUTLINE OF MEET JOHN DOE</h1>
<h2>An Opera in Two Acts by Daniel Catan</h2>
<h3>Analysis and Commentary by Sean Bradley</h3>

<div>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE</strong>: Scene durations and "source material" info is concatenated from the composer's various text notes, and other files recovered from his computer.  These are adjusted / reapplied by me to the rough formal segmentation below; scene timings have not yet been tested for accuracy with the playback of the extant score. The work was in a rapid state of evolution when the maestro died.  The last notes were written about 4:30 in the afternoon on the day he passed; even so: the score and his notes reveal frequent changes to his own original plans for story/scene development.  Presently, the score exists as multiple, versioned Sibelius files, with a limited number of hardcopies available directly from the estate. Prior to this analysis, I ordered the Sibelius files in his computer by the last known time of opening/modification, and built my analysis on the most recent available files.  Some of my observations/suggestions come from conversations with the maestro himself, some via Andrea, his wife, and others are extrapolated from his known by me from earlier works or his known, preferred models of composition. After Act 2, Scene 5...there's much conjecture with regard to the direction of the music, but not, necessarily, his intended modifications to the story, which deviate from the film and his own libretto, and which he spoke about in detail prior to his death.</p>

<h2>STORY</h2>

<p>Two stories in one...</p>

<p>On the surface: weirdly timely in its subject matter, this opera tells the story of what the 99% and Occupy Wall Street <i>should have</i> been.</p>

<p>Deeper: whereas, in his previous operas, it can be argued the composer saw himself in the quieter or supporting role of, for example, a captain piloting the story's other characters to the work's conclusion, we believe Meet John Doe is the bitter/sweet goodbye of a major and self-sacrificing artist, one in which he casts himself front and center, as the story's main protagonist.  Hence, while showing us what the world should be, this story is a profound tragedy on all levels.</p>

<div style="padding-bottom:20px"></div>

<h2>HARMONY</h2>

<p>Occassional ii-V-I progressions, even a deceptive cadences here and there.  Unique cadences; some are really established via the cessation of musical activity, thinning texture, dissipating attack density, etc.  Spelling and voice-leading (when it's there) is often unrelated to function; retrogressions and parallelisms are frequent.  Otherwise, view his harmonic language as relatively simple chromatic verticalities and semi-functional root movement.  Root movement often describes a tonality other than the one it supports.  He was a pianist, and the true harmonic intent is sometimes revealed by pianist voicings. He had a seeming prediliction for add9 and half-dim7 chords, and minor borrowing.  A few "aug6" type chords. Some tritone substition.  However, fully voiced, extended dissonances like 11ths and 13ths are often better thought of as bitonality (as expressed by the composers himself), and, again, that's sometimes made obvious by the voicing, the chosen inversion, etc.</p>

<p>His style and thinking as a composer is not related to set theory whatsoever, so&mdash;as you review the score&mdash;applying a post-tonal analysis technique in your thinking would really be using the wrong tool for the job...that is: if you want to get inside of his head.  His music is arguably never atonal.  Overall, it's certainly not as tightly constructed as his teacher Babbitt, nor even Bartok, but not as harmonically or formally as tight as Puccini either.  It's very horizontally-oriented&mdash;free in what he allows himself to do in order to go to where he wants to go&mdash;in other words, very "composerly", in the same manner a painter might talk about the easy and generous flow and texture of paint to the canvas being "painterly".  So, don't look for organizing principles where they are not... It's intuitive music.</p>

<p>His dominate preoccupation was, indeed, supporting the voice&mdash;"long lines", etc.&mdash;albeit this opera, perhaps more so than any of his others, displays segmentation more akin to music theater.  I think this is apparent in the way he processes text in extended sections of recitative.  As a defining characteristic of opera, there's (almost) no spoken dialogue, but&mdash;in Meet John Doe&mdash;to steal an idiomatic Texan phrase, there "might could" be (i.e., more talking rather than singing in this opera).  The recits are more  speech-like, very natural, but due to their root movement (or lack thereof)&mdash;in comparison to a composer like Mozart's&mdash;Daniel's recit's are not as harmonically "directional" or clear-cut, and, in that actually makes them sound more speech-like (than Mozart's).</p>

<p>In this opera, unlike an earlier work such as Florencia, the root movement is seemingly unhinged from the form, or the trajectory of the opera overall.  Or: at least, based upon the extant score, I cannot determine what tonality he was aiming for by the end of the opera.  E minor looms large in the first act, and I believe this was also the original harmony of Benny Goodman's arrangement of <i>Sing, Sing, Sing</i>, which he indicated in his notes would be a good start to the opera.  He certainly incorporates a bit of, his interpretation of Sing, Sing, Sing into the beginning of the last scene of the first act.  Hence, he may have thought about bookending the entire first act in the harmony of E minor.</p>  

<div style="padding-bottom:20px"></div>

<h2>MELODY</h2>

<p>Know the expansive, soaring lyricism of a Catan melody from earlier operas.  He references this style, but much less frequently than in earlier works.  Instead of whole arias, "Catanism" pops up for 8 to 16 bars at a time, and then drops back down into the highly segmented and simpler melodies that vibe more like music theater.</p>

<p>Throughout the work, he takes his inspiration from the punchiness of Big Band melodies, and leans on the simplicity of Stephen Foster.</p> 

<p>Again, more recit than earlier works.</p>

<div style="padding-bottom:20px"></div>

<h2>FORM</h2>

<p>Note the parallels of formal segmentation and symmetry between first and second act&mdash;for instance, the placement of choral interludes in both.  There is much room in the second act to reference back to motives exposed in the first act.  The two acts will likely have many places where, formally, they mirror each other.  The low toms and swing rhythms of Sing Sing Sing can serve as important formal maypoles or milestones.  Again, it's not clear if harmony, or the overall root movement, drives the form at all.</p>

<div style="padding-bottom:20px"></div>

<h2>TEXTURE</h2>

<p>Used strategically, especially during the convention.  Recall how Mozart ratcheted up the size of the vocal ensemble near the end of Figaro.</p>

<div style="padding-bottom:20px"></div>

<h2>ORCHESTRATION</h2>

<p>The instrumentation should support a sense of Americana...not in a Copland sense, but in a Stephen Foster sense.  The traditions of Appalachian Folk, Parlor Music, Tin Pan Alley, the Swing Era, and the Great American Songbook find their way into this opera.  There's even what appears to be a banjo part in the second act.</p>
